What is the /etc/shadow file and what is its format?


The /etc/shadow file stores actual password in encrypted format for userâ€™s account with additional properties related to user password i.e. it stores secure user account information. All fields are separated by a colon (:) symbol. It contains one entry per line for each user listed in /etc/passwd file. This is what you generally find:

Username: login name.
Password: encrypted password.
Last password change (lastchanged): Days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last changed
Minimum: The minimum number of days required between password changes i.e. the number of days left before the user is allowed to change his/her password
Maximum: The maximum number of days the password is valid (after that user is forced to change his/her password)
Warn: The number of days before password is to expire that user is warned that his/her password must be changed
Inactive: The number of days after password expires that account is disabled
Expire: days since Jan 1, 1970 that account is disabled i.e. an absolute date specifying when the login may no longer be used.
